This project optimizes Ubuntu against the following goals:

  - Maximize usability by installing apps that most users require regularly
  - Maximize security and the user's privacy
  - Reduce the probability of occurrence for errors in a long term

Thus, this project is based on the values of  [Bitleaf â€“ Sustainable IT Solutions](https://www.bitleaf.de).


## How to use

To achieve the above-mentioned goals, this project contains a [list of tasks](https://github.com/bitleaf/optimize-ubuntu/blob/master/all-tasks.md) that are to be applied on an Ubuntu installation.
