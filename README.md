# Optimize Ubuntu

This project ships a script that optimizes Ubuntu against the following goals:

  - Maximize usability by installing apps that most users require regularly
  - Maximize security and the user's privacy
  - Minimize the occurrence of errors in a long term

Thereby, the **usability of Ubuntu is NOT reduced.**

These goals are based on the values of [Bitleaf â€“ Sustainable IT Solutions](https://www.bitleaf.de). See also this [blog post](https://bitleaf.de/2018/04/27/optimize-ubuntu-18-04-for-privacy-security-and-usability/) about the motivation about this tool. 

The script is recommended to use on a regular base. It's configured to install **and** update your machine.


## What exactly does it do?
- Removes unnecessary software, i.e. needless dependencies, old kernels
- Updates your installed software
- Installs useful tools, i.e. Java, Teamviewer, a clipboard manager, chromium browser
- Increases privacy protection, i.e. removes amazon, restricts Ubuntu to send reports to Canonical, Inc.
- Installs Firefox add-ons for better privacy protection and hardens Firefox

The script takes about **5 Minutes** in total to finish all tasks.


## How to use

```
